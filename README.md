# 👋 Hey, I'm Simon  

🚀 Software developer & student with a passion for building, learning, and breaking things (ethically).  
🏀 When I’m not coding, you’ll probably find me on the court working on my shot creation and handles.

## 💻 What I’ve Been Working On  
- **⚡ AI Sports Predictor** – Live app that predicts sports outcomes using machine learning.  
- **🌐 JCL Website** – Full-stack project with a custom React/Tailwind frontend (Vercel) and Express/Node backend (Render).  
- **🎮 Game + Cheats Project** – Building a game from scratch, then creating cheats for it to showcase security & reverse engineering skills.  
- **🌳 Data Structures** – Red-Black Trees in both Java & C.  
- **🔢 Algorithms** – Prim’s and Dijkstra’s implementations for graph problems.  
- **🛠 Systems** – Translating C programs with structs & arithmetic into x86-64 assembly.

## 🧰 Tech & Tools  
- **Languages:** Java, C, JavaScript/TypeScript, Python, C++  
- **Frontend:** React, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui, Vercel  
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express, Render  
- **Other:** Assembly (x86-64), Data Structures & Algorithms, Machine Learning, Git

## 📈 Currently  
- Interning & exploring software engineering opportunities (👀 open to feedback on compensation & career path)  
- Building projects that are both **resume-ready** and **technically deep**  
- Competing in a **20-team guillotine fantasy football league** (yes, it’s as cutthroat as it sounds)  

---

## ⚡ Fun Facts  
- I’m working on a **personal portfolio site** with dark/light mode toggle.  
- I hoop 2–3 times a week — recent runs include 3v3 hot streaks and testing my skills in 5v5.  
- Always down to learn, whether it’s reverse engineering, systems programming, or cooking better broccoli 🥦.
